# To-Do Web Application
## Created by Gabriel Coates, 2023

### Overview
This project was created in an afternoon. I had used Midjourney AI to create 4 different versions of a web application UI for a task management web app. This was the final result after taking in that design. The functionality is a bit iffy and there will be bugs so please don't use this as an actual tracker for your tasks. Not to mention, you can't actually save or export any data so whatever browser you're using is the browser that will store the data.

Maybe one day I will come back to this project or create a new one. For now, the project is considered complete and in decent working condition.

### Tutorial
I highly doubt a tutorial is needed, but here we go.

1. Type your task in the "Name" field.
2. Select what priority the task is at.
3. Click the add button.
4. When the task is completed, click "Finish".
